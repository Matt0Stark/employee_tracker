# Employee tracker

## Description
    this employee CMS allows the creation, viewing and deleting of company roles, departments and employees. It also offers an update functionality enabling updates to employee roles and managers. This CRUD application was put together using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. 

## Credits
lines 21-25 on the db index were given to me by my tutor while trying to get the information to display in the command line.
